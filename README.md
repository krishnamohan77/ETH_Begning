# CustomToken Smart Contract

## Overview

The `CustomToken` smart contract is a simple ERC20-like token implementation on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables fundamental token operations such as minting and burning tokens, as well as tracking the balances of various addresses. The main features of the `CustomToken` contract include:

- **Minting Tokens**: Allows for the creation of new tokens and assigns them to a specified address.
- **Burning Tokens**: Facilitates the destruction of tokens from a specified address.
- **Balance Tracking**: Maintains a record of the token balances of all participating addresses.

The contract is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, making it an ideal starting point for learning about token development on the Ethereum blockchain.
