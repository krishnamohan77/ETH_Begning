CustomToken Contract: Error Handling with Require, Revert, and Assert

The 'CustomToken' contract in Solidity demonstrates the use of require, revert, and assert statements for error handling. This code helps to understand the use of error handling by these statements in a token contract.

Description

The 'CustomToken' Solidity contract includes minting and burning functions to demonstrate error handling mechanisms. The 'mint' function increases the total supply and the balance of the specified address, while the 'burn' function decreases them. The 'burn' function uses the 'require' statement to ensure the specified address has enough balance to 'burn' the tokens. This contract demonstrates how 'require' can be used to validate conditions, ensuring the contract operates correctly and securely.
